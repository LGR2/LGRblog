[{"categories":null,"contents":"Hi there! I\u0026rsquo;m LGR. I\u0026rsquo;m a gap year student from Ireland trying to interrogate the contours of my future careerâ€”and seeing what paths lie ahead. Currently, I work for the ODI as an economic research intern and I\u0026rsquo;m an incoming research intern at Trivium China, working on green finance. My main area\u0026rsquo;s of interest lie at the intersection of economics and data: there\u0026rsquo;s just something so powerful (satisfying?) about shaking out meaningful insights from messy heaps of data. I plan to maintain this blog as a good writing exercise for myself, as well as sharpening my findings from the work I do.\nBeyond this, I also compose (classical) music in my spare time and run a music related Youtube Channel.\n","date":"2022-12-06T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://lgr.pages.dev/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"About"}]
