Hi there! I'm **LGR**. I'm a gap year student from Ireland trying to interrogate the contours of my future careerâ€”and seeing what paths lie ahead. Currently, I work for the ODI as an economic research intern and I'm an incoming research intern at Trivium China, working on green finance. My main area's of interest lie at the intersection of economics and data: there's just something so *powerful (satisfying?)* about shaking out meaningful insights from messy heaps of data. I plan to maintain this blog as a good writing exercise for myself, as well as sharpening my findings from the work I do.

Beyond this, I also compose (classical) music in my spare time and run a music related Youtube Channel.
