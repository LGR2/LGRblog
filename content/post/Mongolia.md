## Introduction to Minegolia

There are a few dozen mines scattered across Mongolia, from the coal mines which have pushed Mongolia along the path of prosperity, to the copper mines that promise to accelerate Mongolia's ascent towards wealth. Most of them were developed by the USSR when Mongolia was a still member. Cooperation in mining between the USSR and Mongolia began in 1949 and continued until the breakup of the USSR, where Mongolia received a truly colossal amount of FDI for its small population of only 2 million. In more recent times, foreign investors have began to develop colossal mining projects, such as the Oyu Tolgoi mine, Mongolia's largest. 

Mongolia is exceptionally well placed to succeed economically. Not only does it sit on trillion of dollars worth of minerals, but it also shares a border with China, the world's largest consumer of many raw material, including copper and coal. Mongolia has taken advantage of their natural resource wealth: over 90% of its exports today come from the mining sector, leading to its rapid economic growth. Yet, despite its vast mineral wealth, Mongolia is a prisoner to two constraints which are paralysing its prosperity and future growth.

## Binding Constraints on Growth's

The first constraint is Mongolia’s infrastructure. For decades, Mongolia relied on poor road and rail infrastructure inherited from the Soviet Union. The recent improvement in road infrastructure yet lack of investment in appropriate rail infrastructure has meant that Mongolia has relied on trucks to transport its mineral exports. This is not ideal: mineral resources, like coal, are high-weight, low-value goods, making road transportation ill-suited to this task. For this reason, transport costs in Mongolia are significantly higher compared to other countries in the region. For example, it is almost 75% more expensive per kilometre to transport a TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) from Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia compared to Tashkent in Uzbekistan-—a doubly landlocked country! 

While Mongolia has thirteen border ports with China, 90% of Mongolia’s exports pass through just three. This immense concentration of export volumes has amplified the congestion that materialises at border ports.  Additionally, there is a risk that overcrowding at these three border ports will occur as the volume of exports trying to pass through will exceed the capacity of these ports. 

The second constraint is China’s Zero-Covid Policy. At the heart of Mongolia’s dilemma for growth is that Mongolia and China differ in their strategy for dealing with Covid. Mongolia’s measures are directed towards “adaptation to living with the virus and on blocking its spread” while China is focused on maintaining its Zero-Covid policy, i.e., zero transmission of the virus. The Zero-Covid Policy impedes the volume of Mongolian exports and increases the border crossing time because of the increased required paperwork and quarantine time for truck drivers. As a result, border crossing times have more than doubled. 

Not only is Mongolia entirely dependent on exporting natural resources, they are also entirely dependnet on China to buy those imports. Mongolia is doubly "cursed" in this sense. 


### Tackling these constraints

Given the importance of mining exports to China to Mongolia’s economy, the Mongolian government has created the New Recovery Policy (NRP) in response to these challenges. One pillar of the NRP is “Border Ports Recovery”. The main thrust of this policy pillar is to increase the capacity of existing ports and to build more roads and rail connections to these ports. If poor transport is a current constraint on exporting more mining products, then these policies will remove them. Considering that the Oyu Tolgoi mine is still ramping up production, this seems to be appropriate and prudent future planning: when the NRP is completed, the Oyu Tolgoi mine will be running at full capacity. When it comes to dealing with China’s Zero-Covid Policy, Mongolia believes wiggle around this constraint if they “strictly follow[s] the infection control regime”. 



### Problems and challenges

Putting aside questions about whether Mongolia can complete the NRP, China’s Zero Covid Policy has the potential to continue to be a binding constraint. Even if Mongolia completes the NRP, Beijing will still ultimately decide “the number of trucks transporting coal that cross the border daily”. Rail transport mitigates this constraint to some extent: presumably more goods can be brought across the border for the same amount of paperwork and quarantine time by drivers. In particular, the recently completed Tavan-Gashuunsukhait rail line will help offset some of the delays caused by additional Chinese import requirements. This, by itself, is not sufficient to get around the Zero-Covid Policy. The latest outlook suggests that the Zero-Covid Policy will remain in place for the foreseeable future. Ultimately, Mongolia’s recovery lies in the hands of Beijing.

Yet, China’s Zero-Covid Policy cannot go on forever. It is too costly. If (when?) it is loosened or axed in the following years, the NRP’s new road and rail infrastructure should come online in tandem with the Oyu Tolgoi mine functioning at full capacity. If this outcome is likely, this pillar of the NRP seems to be worth pursuing, allowing Mongolia to potentially triple their exports.

On a consideration of risk, Mongolia’s policy of solely focusing on improving trade connections with China is unavoidable. Transportation costs through other routes are simply too high to be competitive as they must either be flown out or be routed through Russia to a seaport. Beyond mineral exports, the success of the NRP would make all other Mongolian exports more competitive because of lower transport costs. This is worthwhile pursuing as transportation costs in Mongolia are currently above the global average and—in the long term—Mongolia will need to move away from mineral exports. However, it’s important to note that this gives China considerable leverage over Mongolia. China controls Mongolia’s access to China’s seaports.  

Despite this risk, Mongolia has hung their hat on selling mineral products to China for the immediate future. It plans to export 95 million tons worth of product by 2029; they currently export 32 million tons. But will this demand from China for mineral products continue to exist in the future? China has committed to achieving peak coal use in 2025 and moving away from using coking coal—Mongolia’s main export—to manufacture steel. Furthermore, China has ramped up its domestic production of coal. Yet, China’s imports of coking coal have increased. From where we currently stand, it is difficult to say whether China will ramp down imports of coking coal. 

So, where do we stand now? The NRP has the potential to unlock greater prosperity and economic growth in Mongolia. But whether the improved road and rail infrastructure the NRP plans to deliver will be effectively utilised lies in the hands of Beijing and its Zero-Covid Policy. For the NRP to be a success, it requires Beijing to continue importing Mongolian mineral products and to loosen import restrictions. Both may not be guaranteed. 


## Political Context

### The Democratic Party Policies: 2012-2016
Chinggis Bonds: In 2012, with Mongolia’s economic growth at 17.3% in the previous year, the Democratic Party’s government issued Mongolia’s first bonds. The Chinggis Bond worth USD 1.5 billion. USD 500 million worth had a duration of 5 years with an interest rate of 4.13%, the remainder had a duration of 10 years with an interest rate of 5.125%. The condition was to repay 500 million dollars in 2017-2018 and the remaining 1 billion in 2022. The Chinggis bond was used to fund infrastructure projects. (1) (2) (3)

In 2013, the Democratic Party’s government in power used the Development Bank of Mongolia as a vehicle to fund new policies designed to win them votes. These policies subsidised mortgages, student loans, and credit for herders. These policies led to the government exceeding its capital expenditure. 

### The Mongolian People's Party: 2016 onwards

The Mongolian People’s Party came to power in 2016, beating the Democratic Party. The new government needed to repay the Chinggis bond but lacked the capacity to do so. Moreover, there was an ongoing commodity-price crisis because of China’s slowing growth. (4)

Gerege Bonds: The government swapped the old Chinggis bonds for new Gerege bonds worth USD 800 million. These were issued in 2017 with a maturity of 5.5 years and an interest rate of 5.62% to repurchase previous bonds closing in on their maturity. (5)

IMF: The government sought the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility to pay for the remainder of the bonds. Mongolia received about USD 425 million, which itself was part of a USD 5.5 billion multi-donor financing package supported by Japan, Korea, China, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. In return, the IMF required Mongolia’s government to implement a Fiscal Stability Law, limiting budget expenditure to 5% of GDP. (6) (7)

## Economy

### Economic Problems

Declining Commodity Prices & Uncompetitive Exports: The price of coal and copper fell steadily from 2011 until 2016. Furthermore, demand from China declined.

Protectionist Policies & Falling Investor Confidence: The Democratic Party attempted to renegotiate the terms of the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine, which took a toll on investor confidence. Specifically, new tougher mining laws that sought to increase Mongolian control and income on foreign investor-led mining projects were imposed. Additionally, the second phase of the Oyu Tolgoi project struggled to push forward. (8) (9) However, the election of the Mongolian People’s Party in 2016 restored investor confidence, contributing to higher FDI inflows.

### Dutch Disease in Mongolia

Due to the high levels of FDI inflows in Mongolia, there has been speculation that Dutch Disease exists in Mongolia. Dutch Disease is made up of two effects. The first is the spending effect. In Mongolia's case, this is where the export of mineral products and FDI inflows generate and appreciation of the real exchange rate, an increase in government spending, and the expansion of the non-tradable (i.e. services) sector. The second is the resource movement effect. This is the shift in labour from the traditional manufacturing sector to the mining sector. This is because the appreciation of the rel exchange rate negatively influences the export of non-mineral products. 

From reviewing the literature, the six studies I read all found some evidence of Dutch Disease in Mongolia with varying degrees of strength in their claims. However, most studies did not explicitly claim Dutch Disease exists due to mixed results, unexpected coeffcient values, mitigating factors etc. I plan to try replicate one of these studies in the future, with the added benefit of increased data.

## Mongolia & The BRI

### BRI Projects in Mongolia


### Economic Risks
Given the close relationship Mongolia has with China, some have began to be quite cautious of the loans Mongolia has taken out, even suggesting that Mongolia will have to sell land to be able to repay Chinese loans. Let's consider some economic risks Mongolia faces. 

Debt Repayment & Narrow Economic Base. Mongolia’s economy is centred on mining and commodity exports to China, leaving their economy heavily exposed to volatile commodity prices. Lower commodity prices or a decline in demand from China would present challenges for Mongolia to repay its debt. Furthermore, almost the entirety (~99.8%) Mongolia’s debt is in foreign currencies making it difficult for Mongolia to hedge for exchange rate risk. 


Chinese Ownership? While other countries within the BRI have had to transfer strategic infrastructure to Chinese ownership, e.g. Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port, as a result of being unable to keep up with its debt payments, it is so far difficult to see any Chinese leverage being used to gain BRI funded assets in Mongolia or Mongolia being unable to repay their “1 billion USD” loan from China, as commodity prices are currently high and the Zero-Covid policy begins to ease. It’s worth noting that the BRI funded infrastructure projects in Mongolia are not as strategically valuable to China as ports in other countries. The main beneficiary of the new infrastructure will be Mongolia, allowing them to import and export goods in greater volumes and in shorter times. Considerations of a potential rail line connecting China to Europe that passes through Europe is mitigated by the fact that an existing line passing through Xinjiang already exists. Furthermore, China already has significant leverage over Mongolia as Mongolia’s largest trading partner. Overall, it seems unlikely that Mongolia will be unable to repay their loans or that China has an interest in owning the infrastructure.

Restructuring. However, Chinese loan conditions are “undisclosed” and likely collateralised by mineral resource generated revenue. As this revenue is volatile, there is a distinct possibility of restructuring. While there have been rumours that Mongolia may have to sell land in order to repay the debt, these have been rejected by the government. Another distinct possibility is that China could institute a ‘materials-for-infrastructure’ deal akin to those it has arranged with Venezuela and their oil for loans partnership. 



### What is the current economic outlook (2022)?
Rising Inflation: Inflation has been rising because of disrupted food imports from China and Russia, amplified by the war in Ukraine. “Exports out of Russia have halted, and Mongolia has lost access to the once-steady flow of cereals, oils, dairy products and sugar from its second-biggest import partner.” The Central Bank has raised policy interest rates to 12% (10) (11)

China’s Policies: China’s border closures have meant that Mongolia’s ability to export and take advantage of currently high commodity prices has been weakened. 

FX Pressures: “Weaker export volumes and rising imports due to higher prices and the unleashing of pent-up demand, have led to mounting FX pressure and dwindling international reserves”. (12) These rising imports have been in infrastructure and construction projects. Increasing demand is for consumer durables and services. (13)

Recovery: After 4 successive quarters of economic contraction, the sharp uptick in 2022Q2 GDP largely reflects an acceleration of the ongoing economic recovery in the non-mining sector, especially agriculture. (14)
