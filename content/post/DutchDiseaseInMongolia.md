When I was 13, I attended a lecture. It was called something like "A 625 Student's Guide to English". It was quite good. As someone who didn't have any cultural capital or knowledge about what the exams would entail, it was incredibly useful. It provided the benchmark for the type of standard I would need to achieve to get a perfect score. Having gone through the entire experience, I wanted to offer some thoughts and advice for future LC students. 


I'm going to be writing about something different today. I'm going to be writing about the Irish Leaving Certificate, considering how much attention—and probably stress—it generates. I'm going to split this into three sections. Preparing for the LC, doing the LC, and others.

## Preparation

I'm just going to offer some thoughts on the different ways people try to get a leg up in the LC.

### **Grind Schools**

The Institute of Education. DSOG (or whatever it's called nowadays). Hewitt. Bruce. And all the schools that focus on 'delivering results'. I'm going to put aside the question of whether the existence of these schools is good or bad. I want to focus on if these schools are worth it. I think there is a misconception about the benefits of adding a Grind School. I think students and parents like the idea of minimising things that can go wrong, that is, they will go to a school that claims to provide the best teachers, the best environment, the best support etc. And perhaps maybe even the regular exams will push students to study more, even when they feel unmotivated to do so. 

There is nothing wrong with that. But I think there ought to be more transparency about the entire process. I'll talk about DSOG and the Institute because that is what I have experience with. From conversations with students there and other people who I have a lot of respect for, many of the teachers at these schools are not the best. In fact, they may not be any better than your old teacher that you've now moved away from. The reason is straightforward. Teachers teach to the middle of the class. They teach to a B (H3-H2) grade. So are textbooks. That makes sense. Teach at the most fundamental level and everyone slips. Teach at the highest level and almost nobody follows along. The solution is to meet in the middle. And perhaps, for many students, that is what they want. To move from a H5 up to a H3 or H2. If there was an expectation that students would be receiving H1 classes, that is not true. Achieving the top grades still requires those students to do a lot of work by themselves.

### **Buying 'Notes' from other students**

To put this politely, I don't think buying notes makes any sense. Why?

**You didn't make them**. Generally, I think making notes can be a useful exercise. I am very sceptical of reading someone else's notes as a tool to revise or even learn the material. In particular, if you are doing subjects like Biology or Economics etc. that require you to learn lots of information, this makes even less sense. The reality is that there is simply no substitute for doing the hard work yourself. Buying someone else's notes who (hopefully) has done the hard work themself will not make life easier for you. 

**Low Quality**. Around the start of the new year, there are always a few posts on Studyclix from a 'H1 [Insert Subject] Student', eager to sell you their notes. Having seen the notes given from the Institute, DSOG, and 625point.com—which are low quality—I'm even more sceptical of a former student selling their former notes. Usually, they're just whatever their teacher told them to write down in class, packaged up into a pretty pdf. 

The only exception I have for this is English. Textbooks for poetry and Shakespeare usually do a terrible—sometimes no—job of explaining the features of poetry or the effects they have on the reader. I think this is a product of the previous point I made, i.e. the teachers who use the textbooks want something that falls around the middle of their class. If you want to do well in any of the longer essays in English, get your hands on an essay that has been graded as a H1. Maybe even give it to your teacher to grade, and see what they mark they would give it. In my experience, the quality of what constitutes a H1 between different schools is truly vast. One of my friends showed me a poetry essay that was given a H1 but would probably merit a H3 from my English teacher. For some reason, it can be quite difficult *actually* see a H1 essay. Teachers seem to be quite fond of handing out sample essays that got a H3 or H2...this has no use to me. 

Let me talk a little bit about poetry in particular. Often what notes will give is a summary or explanation of the poem. Sometimes, they will point out features of the poem or techniques that were used. Beyond this, there is little depth. In my experience, the best 'points' you can make about a particular poem will be the ones you find yourself through carefully combing through the poem. Sometimes the internet can help—usually, if you browse Google Scholar for long enough, someone will make an interesting observation about the poem. Most of the time, it won't. That's why you need to carefully think about what you are doing. Sure, everyone will spot the use of imagery; everyone will spot the use of rhyme. What you need to do for a higher grade is to discuss techniques and features most other students won't talk about, and also intelligently talk about them. This is hard work, and it takes a lot of time. But you'll have what almost nobody else will have—and might even surprise your examiner with those lucid insights. 

### **Private Schools**

Among many in the Chinese community (and maybe more widely in Irish society, I can't really say), there is an obsession with attending private schools, if possible. I personally know several families who put their children down on a school's waiting lists as soon as they were born. I'm not sure if this obsession is justified—at least, in Ireland anyway. The private school system is quite odd. Fees are low compared to private schools in the UK, Canada, the US or elsewhere (in the range of €5,000 rather than €50,000 a year) as a result of the state paying for the salaries of teachers who work in private schools. The fees that parents pay only buy you a certain milieu. It usually doesn't guarantee better facilities, bar a few very large private schools. It doesn't guarantee better teachers. My sense is that the presence of private schools at the top of the 'League Table' rankings reflects the parental background and milieu of these students more than what the teachers or 'ethos' the schools are supposed to instil in the students. The Irish-speaking schools Colaiste Eoin and Colaiste Iosagain usually rank at or near the top and are both public schools. However, the schools are located in an affluent area and the parents who teach their children Irish and then send them to an Irish medium school are likely to be affluent themselves. 

Anyway, all this is to say that attending a private school may not be the boost parents—especially new immigrants–might expect it to be. However, my sense could be off. Ideally, I'd like someone who moved from a public school to a private school to weigh in. 

## Advice

The purpose of the previous sections is to explain that you do not need to attend a private school, grind school, or buy notes from anyone to do well in your Leaving Cert. By far, the most important component is how much work you do yourself. So, what should you do to maximise your points?

1. **StudyClix**. Buy StudyClix and get the best package you can afford. Alternatively, you could try to convince someone else to give you access to their account. From my own experience, this is a far better use of your time and money instead of completing the physical past papers that Edco sell. This is because you can do targeted practice and rigorously interrogate every single question on a topic, and be prepared for any 'surprise' questions they might ask. This was invaluable to me for Physics (Particle Physics in particular) and Applied Maths. 

2. **Anki**. For anything that you need to know (I mean anything), stick it into Anki and revise it every day, or as close to every day as possible. If you have a free class, do 10 minutes of Anki. Spaced repetition beats out all the 'techniques' and 'study skills' I was taught by consultants my school invited in. You don't need to think of a pineapple with legs to remember Le Chatalier's Principle. You don't need to think of endless acronyms. Just download Anki. It's free. But a lot of work. 

3. **Library**. Go to it. You'll be amazed by how much work you can get done. I used to do all of my homework in my bedroom. But separating your work and relaxing environment is important, even if you don't realise it consciously. 

4. **Google Drive**. Type out important documents on Google Docs. Any long essay for English or oral scripts will require several redrafts and typing them will be significantly faster. You also won't lose them and can access them anywhere. Take a look over them on the bus or when you have a free class. 

When it comes to exam time, your strategy should change slightly, e.g. start doing full papers in a single sitting to get a sense of timing. Probably more important than actually following the advice above is to have **discipline**. Just do it.
