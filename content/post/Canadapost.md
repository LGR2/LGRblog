## Canada as a Place

I was in Toronto for about a week in July. Coming from the Old World (Ireland), walking through Yonge-Dundas really let me experience the "New World" wealth that us Europeans simply didn't have. Maybe Toronto is the wrong place to go looking for the New World opulence that many in Europe were chasing—after all, Toronto is just NYC from Wish.com . . .

There were a few things that struck me:

- Skyscrapers, skyscrapers, skyscrapers. They're everywhere. I've been to London which is arguably the closest city in vibes to North American cities. It's nothing like London at all.  
- Roads are wide. Really wide. Especially in the city centre.
- UofT. It's right in the middle of the city. Considering how expensive the housing and rental market is right now, it's unsurprising that the other satellite campuses are so far away.
- Distance. Google Maps can deceive. Before I flew over, just looking at the city from Google Maps makes it look deceptively compact. It is not. Walking anywhere is really not an option. Living in the suburbs without a car is probably not possible.

Anyway, that's not what I'm really getting at. Canada, as I saw it, felt like more of a *place* rather than a *country*. It's hard to exactly describe why I felt this, but I'll point at a few things.

- **Culture**. It is probably a step too far to say that Canada as a whole has no culture, but in Toronto it felt as if there was no unifying culture. From speaking to my Canadian friends, they've agreed with this assessment as well. In it's place, the government has noted that the diversity of Canada's population is their strength and unifying trait. This seems like a very weak way to hold a country together. But Canada seems very politically stable, even without comparing it to it's larger neighbour to the south. Toronto has many ethnic enclaves for the various recent immigrants groups—should this be changed to force assimilation? 

Additionally, I noticed that many of the achievements of Canadians are not labelled as such. In the AGO, for example, victories are labelled as the achievements of their ethnic group, not of their nationality. For example, it was a victory for the Chinese-Canadian community, or the Nigerian-Canadian community. Not the Canadian community. While it is true that the different ethnic groups in Canada face varying levels of discrimination, the slicing and dicing of groups into their ethnic groups can make it more difficult to be proud of what your fellow citizens do. It was a Chinese victory—not a Nigerian victory and vice-versa. Perhaps there is something to be said about the approach of the French and their football team. That is: "We are all French".

But, is the presence of a single dominant culture what makes a country feel like, well, a country? Stereotypes about people from a particular culture, while maybe not entirely correct, are usually based in some truth. The Germans tend to be X, the English tend to be Y, and the Americans tend to be Z. The labels I associate with the stereotypes instantly pop into my head. While stereotypes about Canadians being nice and drinking maple syrup abound, it doesn't seem like it would be that easy to differentiate them because those stereotypes are applicable to any group of people, really. When I was in London, there was no doubt I was in England. The English sense of humour, architecture, accent etc. all helped to establish a sense of place for London—it probably couldn't exist anywhere else if it is to retain what makes London London. Toronto, as I experienced it, could exist anywhere else. Toronto is an incredibly diverse city that has a generic North American accent with many skyscrapers. There are many like it. 

Ultimately, it is the people that make a city. Canada's immigration policy, I think, contributes the most towards the feeling I had.

**Immigration Laws** Canada's immigration law is straight forward. It's also relatively easy to immigrate there. Earn enough points set out by clear criteria, and you can come as an skilled worker. Compared to the US (and other English speaking countries), this is significantly easier—additionally if you're from China or India, you're far more likely to eventually become a citizen and stay. No such luck in the US—you won't see a Greencard in your life time just as a skilled worker. Therefore, there's a lot of skilled immigrants from all parts of the world looking for a better life in Canada. I think that has meant that Canada has become a place, rather than a country, that people come to find a better future.
