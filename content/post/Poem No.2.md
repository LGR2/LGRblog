### Remarks

<img src="/IMG_2220.jpeg" alt="lake" width= "500">

Lake Lagunita is a not really a hidden gem, but it is surprisingly empty most of the time. When the sun sets, there is beautiful spectrum of colours that stretches across the sky. It goes from blazing red and purple at the horizon to a very dark blue-black as you look up. Very pretty. It is also my go to place for a walk.

## Lake Lagunita

Moon and planet, we danced \
In our orbit around that lake.\
A vacuum of need and gravity\
Kept us in tension and ache.

We chased after tiny toadlets,\
Cupped hands outstretched\
Grinning at each other as\
The sun bowed and the sky bled.

Colour draining and stars soupy,\
I thought of Helios and Selene:\
Endlessly dancing, chasing, retreating,\
Touching only at eclipses unseen.

But I know not to reveal feeling.\
So Iâ€™ll smile back, stuck in the gyre\
Just as Newton and Kepler wrote.\
I know that this too will expire.
