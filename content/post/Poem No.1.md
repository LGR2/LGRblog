### Remarks

I put this poem together pretty quickly after I came back from a day trip to San Francisco. When I look closely at Heaney's poems I find so much clever material and depth that I feel a little hopeless trying to write poetry can approach his writing. If I don't look too closely at my poem, I like it.

---

When you twitched, \
The footsteps kept rhythm and \
Drivers held their shaded gaze. \
Yet, I looked. I looked at your shaking hands

Plunge deep into your crumpled folds \
Of fabric, head sewn to knees. \
The light turns green: \
I sit dry-throated and pedal.

The traffic insists on it. \
That dream we shared thins, \
Evaporating off the hot concrete, \
Where you and your belongings are scattered.

Down a street, I see you once more, \
But it's your spirit I recognise, \
Not the different flesh. \
You stand, folded like fresh laundry.

That piercing silver glimmer, \
Grasped in a loose fist, \
Is threaded through your black garb. \
Suddenly, I roll past you.

That shared dream precipitates: \
"Tweaker City," my friend chirps. \
I only twitch seeing misery \
Whisper so loudly, so near.
