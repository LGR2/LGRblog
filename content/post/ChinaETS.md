## Preface

[While I was in school, I did an activity called European Youth Parliament. I only did it once for many reasons—mostly because it was bunk.[^0] This post feels a little like the briefings that we had to read, except this is considerably more technical. Anyway, China's ETS is arguably one of the most important tools we should be keeping an eye on. A few percentage points in Chinese emission reduction is just as valuable as an entire European country going carbon neutral.

I wrote this while I worked at Trivium China. I've modified it to make it more casual, which is the tone I'm trying going for on my blog.]

[^0]: I could write a lot about why I didn't like EYP, but I'm probably [just a hater.](https://img.ifunny.co/images/a0ce946904ae7ca64cb961603b728a037cbe21eda47614d6b025d0e72fa5c525_1.jpg)

## Introduction

I don't think it is an overclaim to say that China's Emission Trading System (ETS) will serve as the anvil upon which its carbon-neutral future will be forged. The ETS is perhaps the single most powerful tool China has to reduce emissions and tackle climate change. It's not just important for China that Beijing gets its ETS policy right; it's important in a global context too—China's emissions make up ~31% of the world's total,[^1] so any delta in emissions will be significant in trying to meet the Paris Agreement. 

A recognition of this importance is partly why the EU thought it was critical to share the lessons they had learned from their own ETS with Beijing so that the ramp-up process would be faster and smoother than the likely counterfactual. Unfortunately, the Chinese ETS has not quite been the lodestar we might have hoped it would be. 

We are at an important stage in ETS policy. Several critical policy adjustments are likely to happen in the near future such as expanding the scope of what industries are included in the ETS and addressing data quality issues. These changes will be instrumental in scaling up the degree of net emission reduction—currently, the best estimates of the ETS' contribution to reducing emissions have been close to zero. This post aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Chinese ETS, where it currently stands, what problems it faces, and what direction it might take in the future.

## What is an ETS and how does it work?‎

Generally,[^2] an ETS is a market-based approach to reducing emissions by putting a price on the right to emit pollutants. How does an ETS work?
* Companies are distributed <mark>allowances</mark>—the right to emit a certain of pollutants—by the government. These allowances can be traded. 
* There is an absolute cap on the number of allowances distributed, meaning yearly total emissions are fixed. Over time, this cap is lowered to reduce emissions. 
* The fixed supply of allowances creates a financial incentive for companies to reduce their emissions. Companies that can reduce their emissions more easily than others can sell their surplus allowances, while companies that cannot reduce their emissions as easily have to purchase extra allowances. 
* As the cap is lowered, the supply of allowances is reduced pushing up the price. This further incentivises companies to cut emissions.
* In order to make sure companies aren't cheating, their emissions are checked and verified. At the end of a compliance cycle, companies are required to surrender their allowances to match their verified emissions. 
* Companies that fail to surrender sufficient allowances are subject to penalties. 


[^2]: I say generally because there is a lot of variability between the different ETS around the world. Usually, the variability comes in the form of how the allowances are distributed and how emissions are verified. This is just a small hedge—I explain a few different approaches governments can take. Also, did anyone else know that Kazakhstan or Montenegro had an ETS?

This is an ideal ETS system. The Chinese ETS differs from the ideal in at least two ways. Notice, that I used the word 'distribute' deliberately here. It captures the fact there are several methods of distributing allowances to firms. Let's first consider the unique characteristics of China's ETS and then examine the modalities of how companies are distributed allowances.


### ***The Chinese Context: ETS Design***

It’s worth pointing out three unique features of the Chinese ETS.

1. There is no absolute cap: The total number of allowances that can be distributed does not have an absolute value. This means there is no limit on how much firms can emit in China. This is problematic because it doesn't generate a strong incentive to reduce emissions and likely reduces the price of allowances.
2. Small ETS scope: Only the power sector is currently included in the ETS. For reference, the EU ETS includes power, steel, metals, oil refining, aviation, and several others. While including only the power sector is not ideal, only including a single sector for the moment is not to be sniffed at, as this includes about 46% of all of China’s emissions. 

[*Notice, that this graph underscores the potential scope of possible reduction just from the inclusion of a single industry. By the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> the Chinese National ETS covers, it is already the largest ETS in the world.*]

<iframe title="Greenhouse Gas Emissions by sector, China, 2019" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-QjnK9" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QjnK9/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="399" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++)t[r].contentWindow===e.source&&(t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

3. Intensity-based allowances: The allowances—representing the right to emit one tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>—were based on using CO<sub>2</sub> emission intensity benchmarks, in tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>/MWh for electricity and tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>/GJ for heat generation. I've translated the benchmark values below.[^3] The formula to calculate each firm's allowances is found by multiplying their actual power generation by the reference value and a correction factor. This is unlike the EU ETS which holds firms accountable for their absolute emissions. 

The decreasing reference values in the table below means that firms will be given less allowances for free and will need to buy more as a result.

> Okay cool, but why did they design their ETS in this way? Isn't the design somewhat myopic if the ETS doesn't reduce emissions?

There are a few reasons why policymakers designed the ETS with these limitations.
1. Participation: The primary goal was to encourage participation and to allow regulators to collect data and test the ETS. This was a prudent call. Participation and effective measurement are a precondition for a successful ETS that eventually reduces emissions.
2. Improve Efficiency: An intensity emission-based metric encourages firms to increase the efficiency of their plants or to switch to gas rather than completely switching to renewable alternatives like solar. Again, from a climate standpoint, this is not ideal because it penalises inefficient plants rather than push firms to sunset them. However, it is not in the interest for Beijing to abandon coal just yet for energy security reasons.
3. Flexibility: China’s energy demand is still growing and its industrial capacity is still expanding. It wouldn’t be strategically wise to artificially bind yourself and not ‘walk on two legs’ (两条脚走路方针).[^4] Based on the comments from this year's Two Sessions (两会), the priority this year (2023), is economic growth. If there is going to be a trade off between growth and emissions, growth is going to be prioritised. So, the flexibility makes sense.

It's worth pointing out that arguments premised on increasing participation are shakier than they once were because the ETS has been working since January 2021. Many of the calls from the CPPCC this year have explicitly called for improving the ETS in some fashion, e.g., expanding the scope of the ETS, moving towards auctioning off allowances etc. 

[^4]: lol

### ***Allowance Allocation Methods***

There are broadly two methods to allocate the allowances. Governments can either allocate them for free or auction them off. There are advantages and disadvantages to both systems. The decision to choose one or the other depends on what you're willing to trade-off. China’s ETS does not auction the initial distribution of permits, distributing them all entirely for free. 

#### ***Why Free Distribution?***

1. First, and most obviously, it’s the easiest to do. China has existing problems with institutional capacity, meaning that it would probably be too ambitious to try and set up an auctioning system. Beijing is making efforts to correct this so that the eventual switch to an auction-based system won’t overload the capacity of the MEE. 
2. It compensates for the risk of stranded assets. Power generation is the only sector included in the ETS at the moment. This is important once we recognise the context that China is currently operating in. Much of China’s power generation capabilities come from coal plants that are old and inefficient and/or burn inefficient coal types that are very polluting. A sudden shift towards auctions would leave these coal power plants' value to decrease or become worthless. There is no incentive to do this because of the financial risks involved.
3. Low initial trading capacity. Firms might make mistakes or fail to comply. The first phase allows China to resolve teething problems and improve the robustness of its monitoring system. This is a crucial capability to have. The entire ETS only works if the data is accurate and firms are not shirking their responsibilities by lying to regulators about the true amount of their emissions. 
4. A note about gas-fired power plants: Gas-fired power plants do not have a compliance obligation, meaning they do not need to buy more allowances if they come up short. This partly incentivises firms to switch to gas, although the size of this incentive is not very large as gas power plants have their own category to prevent them from being allocated a large number of allowances which they can later sell. 

Free allocation is difficult to reconcile with the most important goal of an ETS, which is, reducing emissions. This is because free allocation reduces the price of allowances and with it the magnitude of the financial incentive to switch to more efficient or greener forms of energy. Additionally, it doesn’t encourage firms that already have low emissions to reduce anymore. Efficient power plants can simply sell their surplus each year and not make any efforts to reduce their emissions. However, for the time being, Beijing has decided that this is an acceptable trade-off for them to make. The exact calculus they are using will shift into the future, as reducing emissions begins to take priority over familiarising firms with the ETS.

#### ***Other Allocation Methods***

Auctioning is the other most common allocation method, where allowances are auctioned off to firms and other market participants. This is the most preferable method because it both raises revenue for the government and allows for the true value of the allowances to be discovered by all in the marketplace. This is important because it means abatement happens where it is most efficient. Beijing has noted that the ultimate trajectory of the ETS will terminate in a paid allocation of allowances. Considering China's economic context, this is preferable for a few reasons. The most salient reason is to minimise any potential lobbying or preferential treatment. Many of the largest polluters in China are SOEs which have a significant influence on policymaking. Other ancillary benefits, like raising revenue, allow the government to spend more on the green transition. 

Interestingly, policymakers have introduced a proposal to allow enterprises to “borrow” their allowances from next year to meet their compliance requirements this year.[^5] This is only possible when certain conditions are met (the gap between the quotas given and verified emissions is greater than 10% and the firm has operational difficulties) and serves as a stopgap for relieving the burden on struggling firms. The thinking behind this is to reduce the financial burden on companies as the quantity of allowances given to firms tighten (see table with reference values). Considering that the prices of allowances are already low, this seems unwise. The point of the ETS is to incentivise firms to reduce their emissions by making them pay to emit. Allowing firms to borrow from next year only increases the supply of allowances in the short term, further lowering carbon prices. As we'll see later, the price and trade volume of allowances is already weak.

### What are exchanges?‎

The role of the exchange in the ETS is to enable the trading of allowances between companies and other market participants. While there are several regional exchanges in operation in China, there are three that are worth paying attention to. 
* Shanghai Environment and Energy Exchange: This is the national trading platform where firms trade allowances.
* The Beijing Green Exchange: This the national trading platform for voluntary carbon credits and for domestic offsets (CCERs)
* The Hubei Carbon Emissions Exchange: This exchange handles the registration of different companies until a new official national ETS registry is established. 

The only trading that currently takes place is spot trades. No derivatives are currently traded. 

### ***What is the CCER?‎***
The China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) is a scheme to allow companies to voluntarily reduce their emissions, for example, by building renewable power sources. Upon being certified, the firm is given a credit which the firm can use to meet its compliance obligations for up to 5% of its verified emissions. These credits—just like allowances—can be traded between firms, although their trading price was lower price at around ¥20 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> compared to around ¥40 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> for allowances. As CCER credits are cheaper than CEAs, we should recognise that they are cheaper substitutes and contribute to lowering the price of CEAs as they expand demand. Yet, CCER credits are a useful tool to have in the MEE’s toolbox as they allow firms to redirect finance into mitigation efforts, supporting industries like renewable energy which are currently not covered under the ETS.

The CCER was gutted and suspended in 2017 by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC, China's macro planner) because of issues of standardisation in carbon audits (sound familiar?) and low trading volumes. There are a few signals which suggest that the CCER will be restarted soon.
* The new compliance cycle document has been released. The CCER needs to work in lockstep with the allocation of CEAs to avoid adding too much supply into the market and reducing the price of carbon—this is what happened in the first compliance cycle. 
* The CBGEX has built a new trading centre for CCERs and is ready to begin trading.
* At this year's Two Sessions, many prominent memebers of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC/政协) have called for the CCER to restart as soon as possible. While there is always some degree of uncertainity in predicting whether Beijing will implement the proposals forwarded by the CPPCC, it is clear that there is a want for the CCER to be revived.

### ***Challenges with the ETS***

As I flagged in the introduction, data quality and monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) issues are the largest issues facing the ETS. The voracity of emission data is crucial for the ETS to function. 

Some of the emission data is fraud, i.e., firms deliberately misrepresenting their emissions. For example, companies can buy small amounts of high-quality coal and submit it for examination but then actually burn cheaper, low-quality coal to generate power.[^6] Yet, it's not necessarily that (all) firms are trying to commit fraud either. Prior to the creation of the national ETS, the pilot Beijing ETS had random inspections to verify emission reports. They found that the self-reported emissions data deviated in both directions,[^7] suggesting that firms lack the ability to accurately measure their emissions. Regardless, the MEE has noted that inconsistencies have been found in ~80% of the power companies' data. New regulations that aim to correct the poor data have been implemented this year. These regulations should improve data quality and serve as a template for future sectors that will be brought into the ETS' fold.[^8]

A large problem with the ETS is the omission of a credible deterrent. The penalty for violations is a maximum of *only* ¥30,000, or about €/$4000. Not great. Beyond deterrence, there are still conflicts of interest between those who inspect firms to ensure their emissions are accurate. The problem arises because the MEE has delegated inspection duties to provincial governments, which are all competing to secure maximum economic growth. Additionally, the ability of provincial governments to carry out inspections is dubious as there are questions if they have the manpower or technical ability. One approach to sidestep this issue would be to use independent third-party auditors to interrogate the data each firm produces. This is currently the approach the EU uses.

To be fair, the Draft Interim Regulations have bumped the fines up to a minimum of ¥100,000 and a maximum of ¥500,000.[^9] But it's still just a draft...

Looking towards the future, industry-specific emissions calculations are a large obstacle. There have not been any robust mechanisms or carbon emission statistical accounting plans drawn up to calculate the emissions that are produced by other industries—currently, it has only been for the power sector. This is a problem because it again creates another obstacle for the ETS to expand into other sectors and ultimately slows down the process of emission reduction in China. 




## Supply and Demand Dynamics

### ***Price and Trade Volumes***

</script>

The price of allowances depends on demand and supply. However, compared to other ETS around the world the price of allowances is unusually low, cf. the price of allowances in the EU ETS is ~€100 a ton. What factors are contributing to the low price? 

Broadly there are four:
1. Overallocation of permits and CCERs. The first compliance cycle generously distributed more than enough allowances for the power sector to cover all of its emissions. The oversupply of allowances drove the price down. Additionally, the free allocation of permits dented the enthusiasm of firms to purchase more permits. The use of offsets introduced even more supply into the market. 

2. Weak demand by firms due to the low cost of improving the inefficiencies of many coal plants. Switching to gas power plants is not the most expedient way to meet the obligations. Rather, it is to reduce the intensity of emissions. Many coal plants in China are quite old and inefficient, so the cost of upgrading equipment or changing coal is very low, making demand for allowances weak. 

3. Long time until surrender. The length of the compliance is two years. What tends to happen is that there is little trading volume until nearing the end of a compliance cycle. Additionally, the fact that crabbed regulations for carrying over unused allowances from last year and general regulatory uncertainty meant that many firms didn't purchase allowances. Notice the low trading volume until December (highlighted in yellow), the last month before the new compliance cycle begins.

4. Low Liquidity: This reduces the incentive of companies to save or trade their allowances because it means they have to potentially discount the value of the allowance in order to sell it quickly. 

All of these factors play a role in the price formation of carbon allowances. From looking at the graph above, the price of allowances only increases in December, the last month for firms must surrender their allowances.

</script>

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has recently allowed at least 8 domestic financial institutions access to participate in carbon trading. While they are not allowed to trade on the national market (yet), this is a step in the right direction and will help increase market depth and liquidity.[^10] I'll talk a little more about this later on. 



[^10]: https://www.jiemian.com/article/8853935.html










## What does the future look like?‎

Now that we've pretty comprehensively covered the ETS and examined the reasons behind its current design, what can we expect to change in the future?

**Sector expansion**. Since the ETS was founded, it was been the goal of the MEE to cover eight sectors that are highly polluting.[^11] While it probably won't happen in 2023, the third compliance cycle will likely see the incorporation of other sectors into the national ETS, now that the government has more space to focus on other issues. Additionally, the EU's new Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will likely accelerate the inclusion of sectors like iron and steel into the ETS sooner rather than later. 

[^11]: These are power generation, petrochemical, chemical, building materials including cement, steel, non-ferrous metals, pulp and paper, and aviation

**Carbon derivatives**. The introduction of carbon derivatives is long overdue at this point. Carbon derivatives are a relatively easy addition and will grant firms more flexibility to hedge for risk. 

**Market participant expansion**. More financial institutions and potentially other market participants will be allowed to trade allowances. The participation of more financial instutions married with the introduction of new carbon derivatives will go a long way to improving liquidity and market depth. The trajectory is postitive cf. the most recent inclusion of eight securities firms. 

**CCER Restart**. The CCER should make an appearance very soon. While there were little details about it in the most recent regulations about this year's compliance cycle, I'd be surprised if it doesn't make an appearance by 2024.

**Auctioning**. The ETS will eventually move away from a free distribution of allowances and move towards auctioning off the allowances. 

**Absolute Cap**. We can expect that the ETS will move away from an intensity based metric and move towards an absolute cap on emissions that will decline over time. 

Given the trajectory of the ETS to meet the goals of the MEE set out—and few signals to suggest deviations—these are some general takeaways. 


## So, where do we stand now?‎

China's period of leaning into each twist and turn of the ETS, of seeing what works and what doesn't, is coming to an end soon. After this year's Two Sessions, I think we are at an important juncture. This will be the period where can expect several reforms that will begin a new chapter in the story of China's ETS: this chapter will be about reducing emissions. But it has to solve some important problems before we can turn the page. Issues like data quality and sector expansion need to be solved first. Once that happens, the bulk of this story will be written, and become a lot more interesting.
