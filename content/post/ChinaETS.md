## Preface

[I feel like one of those poor kids who did EYP, except perhaps this is considerably more technical. Anyway, this is arguably one of the most important tools we should be keeping on eye on. So yeah. I also wrote this as my project while I worked at Trivium China. It's been modified to make it more casual, which is the tone I'm reach to reach on my blog.]


## Introduction

China’s ETS is one of the single most powerful tools China—and the world—has to reduce emissions and prepare for a carbon-neutral future in order to tackle climate change. China’s emissions make up ~31% percent of the world’s total, so the lessons learned here will be incredibly valuable for other countries that start their own ETS. That’s partly why the EU thought it was critical to share the elssons they’d learned so that China’s ramp up process would be quicker and smoother, providing their exeprertise to smooth out the initial teething problems that they had experienced . This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the ETS in China, where it currently is, what problems are facing it, and where it might go into the future. 












## What is an ETS and how does it work?‎

Generally, an Emission Trading System (ETS) is a mechanism to reduce emissions by putting a price on emitting pollutants. Companies are distributed allowances, which is a right to emit a certain amount of pollutant, which can be traded. At the end of a compliance cycle, companies are required to surrender their allowances to match their verified emissions. Companies can sell surplus allowances and buy allowances to cover any shortfall. Companies that fail to surrender sufficient allowances are subject to penalties. 

The key mechanism underlying the ETS is a ‘cap and trade’ principle, i.e., there is an absolute cap on the total number of allowances that are issued, the quantity of which declines over time. This creates a financial incentive for firms to reduce their emsisions, in order to to avoid paying for increasingly expensive emission permits, or to earn a profit by selling their surplurs allowances. As supply of allowances restrictis over time, this forces companies to invest in more efficient of green production methods, which ultimately reduces carbon emissions. The power of the ETS is that is incentivise firms who can reduce now, to make the necessary investments to improve their technology in order to improve efficiency and reduce emissions. 

However, the Chinese ETS differs from an ideal ETS in at least two ways. Let’s first examine the modalities of how companies are distributed allowances.  

### **Chinese Context: ETS Design**

It’s worth pointing out two unique features of the Chinese ETS.

1. The total number of allowances that can be distributed does not have an absolute value. This means there is no limit on how much firms can emit in China. 
2. Only the power sector is currently included in the ETS. While not ideal, only including a single sector for the moment is not to be sniffed at, as this included about 45% of all of China’s emissions. (graph).

</script>

(This graph underscores the potential scope of possible reduction ~46% comes from power generation industry)

What is the thinking behind this design?
1. The aim was to encourage participation and allow regulators to collect data and test the system. This is a prudent call. Participation and effective measurement is a precondition for a successful ETS.
2. An intensity emission based metric encourages firms to increase efficiency rather than to completely switch to renewable alternatives, like solar. Again, from a climate standpoint this is not ideal, because it penalises inefficient plants. 
3. It gives flexibility in the future. China’s energy demand is still growing and it’s industrial capacity is still expanding. It wouldn’t be strategically wise to artificially bind yourself  and ‘walk on one leg’. 

### Allowance Allocation Methods

There are broadly two methods to allocate the permits to pollute. Governments can either allocate them for free or auction them off. There are advantages and disadvantages to both systems. China’s ETS does not auction the initial distribution of permits, instead calculating the emissions intensity of the average power plant and then allocating permits accordingly. In the absence of an absolute cap, this encourages firms to reduce emissions.

**What are the advantages of free distribution?**

1. First, and most obviously, it’s the easiest to do. China has existing problems with institutional capacity, meaning that it would be too ambitious to try and set up an auctioning system. Beijing is making efforts to correct this so that the eventual switch to an auction based system won’t overload the capacity of the MEE. 
2. It compensates for the risk of stranded assets. Only power generation is the only included sector at the moment. This is important once we recognise the context that China is currently operating in. Much of China’s power generation capabilities comes from coal plants that are old and inefficient and or burn inefficient coal types that are very polluting. A sudden shift towards auctions would leave these coal power plants' value to decrease or become worthless. There is not an incentive to do this for financial risks that come with this. 
3. Low initial trading capacity. They might make mistakes or fail to comply. The first phase allows China to improve the robustness of its monitoring system. This is a crucial capability to have. The entire ETS only works if the data is accurate and firms are not shirking their responsibilities by lying to regulators about the true amount of their emissions. 

A note about gas fired power plants:

Gas fired power plants do not have a compliance obligation so they don’t need to buy moere allowances when they come up short. This is to encourage firms to switch away from coal plants to gas plants. 

However, this free allocation is difficult to reconcile with the most important goals of an ETS, that is,  reducing emissions. 
* Free allocation reduces the price of allowances and with it the the magnitude of the financial incentive to switch to more efficient or greener form of energy.
* It doesn’t encourage firms that already have low emissions to reduce anymore. Efficient power plants can simply sell their surplus each year and not make any efforts to reduce their emissions.

However for the time being, Beijing has decided that this is an acceptable trade off for them to make. The exact calculus they are using will shift into the future, as reducing emissions begins to take priority over familiarising firms with the ETS.

Allocation methods. 

1. **Paid**: This allocation method auctions off the allowances to firms. This is the most preferable because it both raises revenue for the government, and allows for the true value of the allowances to be discovered by all in the marketplace. The plan is to eventually shift to a paid allocation. What are the benefits of this:
    - Minimises chances of market distortions from lobbying or preferential treatment. Considering that many of the largest polluters in China are SOEs, this can be an important consideration.
    - Rewards early action. Those who have already taken step to reduce their emissions will face lower compliance costs. Note that in comparison to free allocation, this is preferable because it still encourages those who have taken action to continue to reduce their emissions rather than to just sit on their money. 
    - Give the permits to those who value them the most. Economically efficient in this sense. 
    Raises revenue to be used by governments for other uses. 
    - Improved information about prices (price discovery). Reflects the true price of the market. 


2. **Borrowing from next year** Policymakers are reportedly considering a proposal to allow enterprises to “borrow” their allowances from next year to meet their compliance requirements this year. The thinking behind this is to reduce the financial burden on companies. Ultimately, the ETS's entire purpose is to incentivize businesses to reduce their emissions by making them pay to emit. Increasing the effective supply of near-term free allowances increases supply, lowers carbon prices, and reduces the pressure to decarbonize in the  short term. Meanwhile, today's emissions are more valuable than tomorrow's emissions, undermining the system.



### Challenges with the ETS

**Data quality issues.**
As previously flagged, monitoring and insufficient institutional capacity are major issues. MRV and institutional capacity will be beefed up in the future years, potentially addressing these problems.
There are currently also conflicts of interest. Provincial departments are the one’s in charge of verifying the emissions of power generating firms. However, obviously provinces are all competing to secure maximal economic growth. A more independent approach would be to use independent third party auditors to interrogate the data each firm produces. This is currently the approach the EU uses.
Penalties are insufficient to maximally punish or deter violations. As it is run be the MEE, penalties are capped at 30,000 yuan. When this is moved into the remit of the State Council, penalties can be much higher. 


**Indusitry specific emissions caluclations**
There have not been any robust mechanisms or carbon emission statistically accounting plans drawn up to calculate the emissions that are produced from other industries—currently it has only been for the power sector. This is a problem because it again, creates another obstacle for the ETS to expand into other sectors and ultimately slows down the process of emission reduction in China. 




## Supply and Demand Dynamics

</script>

The price of the CEAs depend on demand and supply. However, when compared to other ETS, the price is unusually low in an international context. What factors are distorting the market?

Broadly there are four reasons:
1. Overallocation of permits and free allocation
2. Weak demand by firms as a result of the low cost of improving the inefficiends of many coal 
3. plants and weak enforcement
4. Lack of liquidity in the markets
