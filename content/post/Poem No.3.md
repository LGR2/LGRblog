### Remarks
Writing good free verse poetry is difficult. But after trying hand at writing poetry with a fixed rhyme scheme and syllable count for each line, I can say the latter is significantly harder. I typically end up scowering rhyming dictionaries to find a word that might fit. Of course, I usually don't get so lucky as to stumble across a word that just so happens to fit *just like that*. I usually just end up rewriting the whole thing. *C'est la vie*. 

This poem is a first attempt at trying to write a poem with those constraints shackled onto me.

## Dumplings

Conscripted and armed with a rolling pin, \
I was all hers as we made dumplings. Press \
The dough flat—semiquavers, legato—\
Stacking discs into pagodas: like this.

I watched her fingertips guide each wrapping\
into their delicate first kiss, sealing\
Away their shared heart. She boils them, alive,\
slowly—love's crucible of feeling.

My creator's fingers have gone through me.\
I have been torn apart, flattened, rolled flat, \
filled, and pinched at the edges to perfection.\
Yet, I understand, knowing I am glad.

So, in my own way, I will fall apart\
When I come home to billet. Turned to stone,\
Gripping the rolling pin tight as I make\
dumplings—always my favourite—alone.
