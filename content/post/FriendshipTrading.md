## Preface

[This started out as a joke I made with my friend, but when I thought about some more I thought it could be a useful heuristic to think about friendships and your relationships with others. This is also not that serious.]


## I.

> "Arguably friendships are just high frequency transactional relationships. Goods and services exchanged including emotional support." 

My friend doesn't *really* believe this. But on some level, this claim is probably true, it's a bit weird to think about friendships in these terms. It reminded me of the kids in school who would preach that *love is fake, it's just those silly chemicals in your brain. It's just an instantiation of the biological need to ensure pass on your genes*. I mean, they're not entirely wrong, but it does feel like a very reductive and cynical view. In some sense, I think it's somewhat emblematic of a the trend—at least among some men—of pathologising emotions/love/attachment as a weakness, something that needs to be cut out.[^1] *Don't fall in love guys!! It'll kill your gains/career/other important goal!!* I'm exaggerating, but it maybe it goes someway in explaining why some guys in my school liked to tout this view.

Anyway, I'm just going to share some thoughts about applying financial concepts to relationships (as a joke / bit of fun / also poking fun at some of the crazier people in the rationality community), assuming we're thinking of friendships as purely transactional "investments". To be clear, I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. 

1. **Sharpe Ratio**. The Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure of investment performance where higher is better. Because we (as utility maximising sociopaths) want to think of investment performance as how much "benefit" we get by trading our emotional support etc. How can this map onto friendships? Generally, we'd (probably) prefer a partner who is quite "stable", i.e., they don't have periods where they don't talk to you (low performance) or where they are extremely attentive (high performance). Say we have two friends, A and B, and over a period of 1 year they both give us a "return" of +100 happiness points. Except, A is very variable (low sharpe) and B is very stable (high sharpe). Why might we not like friend A, even though the end return is the same. 
    * It makes them difficult to have around. The highs are very high and the lows are very low.  And because most of us of are loss averse, sadness from losses > happiness from gains. The losses will outweigh the gains and makes any holding experience very unpleasant. 
    * It makes us less confident in our relationship going forward. After moving up and down so much, it's feels like friend B could be in any state, whereas friend A would be making steady gains.  
    * If we suddenly needed support from our friend for some reason, B might not be much use to us. 
    
2. **Return on Investment**.
